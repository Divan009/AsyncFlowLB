## Overview
The Load Balancer system is designed to:
- Distribute incoming HTTP and TCP traffic across multiple backend servers.
- Monitor the health of backend servers to ensure traffic is routed only to healthy servers.
- Provide scalability, high availability, and reliability.
- Support multiple load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, and Least Connections.

---

## High-Level Architecture
The Load Balancer consists of several key components working in tandem:

- **Client**: Sends requests (HTTP/TCP) to the Load Balancer.
- **Load Balancer**: The central orchestrator that routes traffic to backend servers.
- **Health Check Module**: Continuously monitors backend servers and updates their statuses.
- **Server Pool**: Stores and manages the list of backend servers.
- **Backend Servers**: Handle application-specific workloads (e.g., serving web pages, processing data).

## Core Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each component (LoadBalancer, HealthCheck, ServerPool) is independently designed, enabling easy testing and maintenance.
2. **Extensibility**: New load balancing algorithms or health check protocols can be added without modifying existing functionality.
3. **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling of backend servers to handle increasing workloads.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Automatically detects and removes unhealthy servers from the pool.

## Component Interactions

### 1. Load Balancer
- **Responsibility**: 
  - Initialize and manage HTTP/TCP servers.
  - Forward requests to healthy backend servers based on the selected load balancing algorithm.
- **Interactions**:
  - Retrieves healthy servers from `ServerPool`.
  - Updates algorithms when the health of servers changes.

### 2. HealthCheck
- **Responsibility**:
  - Continuously monitor backend server health using configured protocols (HTTP or TCP).
  - Update server health statuses in `ServerPool`.
- **Interactions**:
  - Uses the `ServerPool` to mark servers as healthy or unhealthy.

### 3. ServerPool
- **Responsibility**:
  - Maintain the state of backend servers (e.g., healthy/unhealthy).
  - Provide the list of healthy servers to the Load Balancer.
- **Interactions**:
  - Interfaces with `HealthCheck` for updates on server statuses.
  - Provides healthy servers to the Load Balancer for request forwarding.

### 4. Backend Servers
- **Responsibility**:
  - Handle client requests forwarded by the Load Balancer.
- **Interactions**:
  - Receives forwarded requests and sends responses back through the Load Balancer.

## Deployment Architecture
The Load Balancer is designed for deployment in a containerized or virtualized environment to ensure portability and scalability. 

### Typical Deployment
1. **Single Load Balancer Deployment**:
   - Suitable for smaller-scale systems.
   
[ [ Client ] ---> [ Load Balancer ] ---> [ Backend Servers ]Client ] ---> [ Load Balancer ] ---> [ Backend Servers ]


2. **Multiple Load Balancer Deployment**:
- For high availability and fault tolerance, multiple Load Balancers can be deployed behind a DNS-based traffic distribution mechanism.

[ Client ] ---> [ DNS ] ---> [ Load Balancers ] ---> [ Backend Servers ]

## Data Flow

### HTTP Request Flow
1. A client sends an HTTP request to the Load Balancer.
2. The Load Balancer retrieves the list of healthy servers from `ServerPool`.
3. The load balancing algorithm selects the most appropriate server.
4. The request is forwarded to the selected backend server.
5. The backend server processes the request and sends a response.
6. The Load Balancer relays the response back to the client.

### TCP Request Flow
1. A client establishes a TCP connection with the Load Balancer.
2. The Load Balancer selects a healthy server using the load balancing algorithm.
3. The connection is proxied between the client and the selected server.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Asynchronous Framework**: `asyncio`
- **HTTP Library**: `aiohttp`
- **Configuration Management**: `pydantic` for schema validation
- **Testing**: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `unittest.mock`

---

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

### Scalability
- **Backend Server Scaling**: Add new servers dynamically to handle increased traffic.
- **Horizontal Scaling of Load Balancers**: Deploy multiple instances of the Load Balancer behind a DNS or hardware load balancer.

### Fault Tolerance
- **Health Checks**: Automatically detect and remove unhealthy servers from the pool.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.

---

## Limitations
1. **Dynamic Configuration**: Currently, configuration changes (e.g., adding new servers) may require a restart.
2. **Lack of Advanced Features**: Missing features like sticky sessions, SSL termination, and connection draining.
3. **Single Point of Failure**: If deployed as a single instance, the Load Balancer can become a bottleneck.

---

## Future Architectural Considerations
1. **Dynamic Configuration Reload**: Implement support for hot-reloading configurations without downtime.
2. **Sticky Sessions**: Route client requests to the same server for session persistence.
3. **SSL Termination**: Add support for handling HTTPS traffic.
4. **Observability**: Integrate metrics collection and distributed tracing for better monitoring.

## Conclusion
The Load Balancer is a modular, extensible system designed to handle HTTP and TCP traffic efficiently. By leveraging asynchronous programming and modern design patterns, it ensures high availability and scalability. Future enhancements can further improve its capabilities and make it suitable for more complex production environments.
